# Machine learning tools to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation

## What is this repository?
It contains the code referred to in this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12795). The repository contains a detailed PyTorch implementation of the method of *Neural Quantum States* for three different quantum systems, as a first resource for teaching purposes and also as a guide for those starting in the field. 

## Installation & Requirements
The machine learning part of the code in the files above is written in PyTorch, which is not included by default with Python 3. To install it, go to the [Official PyTorch page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for a customized install, or alternatively type:

`pip3 install torch`

Also, the package `tqdm` is used to display progress bars. To install it:

`pip3 install tqdm`
