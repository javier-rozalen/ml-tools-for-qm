# Machine learning tools to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation

## What is this repository?
It contains the code referred to in this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12795). The repository contains a detailed PyTorch implementation of the Neural Quantum States method for three different quantum systems, as a first resource for teaching purposes and also as a guide for those starting in the field. 

## Files
There are three notebooks blah blah blah.
